## The QGIS Interface 
![QGIS interface](/images/qgisinterface.jpg)

* First, if you are more comfortable, feel free to change the interface language:
  * Settings (or extra) --> options --> Locale --> (click to override) then chose language --> restart the program to apply the new settings
* Note the add data to the left, in blue. It can add vector, images, WMS or WCS live layers, tables (e.g. CSV) and layers from databases.
* Note typical GIS application layout for layer order, zoom in/out, selection, ect.
* Browser Window is a hand way to see supported data sets.
* Bottom right, circled in orange, is key to support changing current projections and setting on-the-fly map projections capabilities.
* Plugins offer hundreds of tools to test. Many more listed as experimental (to see these, you must turn on the option under plugin settings).
* Note the Project Save. This does not save data but save a project for what layers are loaded and how they are stylized.
