## Field Statistics
Calculating statistics against the table fields is easy using the “Show Statistics Summary”. Just press the button from the main interface. In the next dialog, just select the layer you are interested in and the field. This is useful for numeric fields (left – below) but it even works for text fields, which is very nice (right – below).
