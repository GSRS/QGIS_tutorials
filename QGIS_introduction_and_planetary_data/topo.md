## Working with DEMs (topography)
QGIS has several routines to help work with DEMs (digital elevation models) from 3D views, contours, hillshading, slopes, etc. DEMs can also be called DTMs (digital terrain models). While QGIS works well with raster DEMs, it also has routines to help interpolate DEMs from point date (e.g. LIDAR). Also, search for plug-ins including larger processing toolboxes from SAGA GIS , GRASS GIS, R, and TauDEM which includes some hydro-modeling routines.
Besides the MOLA global DEM, you can find hundreds of DEMs from the HRSC and HiRISE Teams for Mars: http://hrscview.fu-berlin.de/cgi-bin/ion-p?page=entry2.ion, http://www.uahirise.org/dtm/

For both HRSC and HiRISE DEMs they will be downloaded in PDS (v3) format, which work directly in QGIS. For HRSC you will want the “DA4” versions which vertically line-up with the MOLA DEMs.
