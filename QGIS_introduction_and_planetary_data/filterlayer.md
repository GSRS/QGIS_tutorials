## Filtering Layers
Taking the same nomenclature layer, let us try to show only one feature type (e.g. 'Mons, montes'). One the layer, right click and select “Filter…”.  This will bring up the Query Builder. For the feature types, select “type” und Fields. To get a listing of values you can click Sample or All buttons to see the different type of attributes listed. To build the equation, double click “type” and then hit the “=” buttons, and then the type of feature you want to filter on.

* Now with only these features selected, try the statics button again.
* You can load this same file and filter on another feature type to split the same file across multiple layer viewers, which can also help to show labels for specific features (below)
